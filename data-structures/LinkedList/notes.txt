Can have a singly and doubly linked list. 
- Access: 0(n)
- Search: 0(n)
- Insertion: 0(1)
- Deletion: 0(1)

When to use over an ARRAY?
- You need CONSTANT-time insertion/deletion
- You don't know how many items will be in the list. Otherwise, we'd need to redeclare with an array.
- No need to randomly access any elements
- Want to insert items in the middle of the list. Don't need to reorganize entire data structure.
