while vs do-while
- While: the condition is tested at the beginning of the loop
- Do-while: executes the statement in the code block at least once even if the condition fails

FOR-IN LOOP (Objects)
- iterates through props of an object and executres the loop's body once for each enumerable property of the object
let student = { name:"Bill", age: 25, degree: "Masters" };
for (let item in student) {
   alert(student[item]);     // => "Bill", then 25, then "Masters"
}

FOR-EACH LOOP (Arrays)
const arr = [1,2,3,4];
arr.forEach(function(element){
      console.log(element);      
    });




Continue and Break 
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
  console.log(i);
}

Prints...
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

- Continue — The continue statement terminates execution of the current iteration in a loop.
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
  if (i % 2 == 1) continue;
  console.log(i);
}

Prints...
2
4
6
8
10

- Break — The break statement breaks (stops) the execution of a loop entirely.
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
  if (i == 6) break;
  console.log(i);
}

Prints... 
1
2
3
4
